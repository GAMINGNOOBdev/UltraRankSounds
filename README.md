# About this mod
This is a mod done in about two days that just plays a sound whenever your style rank increases or decreases.\
**Note**: The current sounds are made using Microsoft SAM.

> **IMPORTANT**\
> Currently for some reason, mod managers like to extract the audio files OUTSIDE the sounds folder,\
> so please if you would like to bare with me until i find the issue could you just open sound folder\
> from the plugin config panel, go up a directory and move all .mp3 files into the sound folder, thanks.

# Current features
- Disabling all sounds (so you can have the mod loaded but disable it in a plugin preset)
- Changing volume (currently not synced to master volume)
- Enabling, if sounds should be played when the rank decreases
- Customizable sounds (by replacing the audio files)

# Installation
Download the zip from the releases and extract it's contents to ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins.

# Customizing sounds
To customize sounds, open the `UltraRankSounds` panel in the plugin configs. \
Then click on `Open sounds folder` and just replace any sound file. \
Which file names associate to which rank should be pretty self-explanitory.
