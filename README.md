# About this mod
This is a mod done in about two days that just plays a sound whenever your style rank increases or decreases.
Note: The current sounds are made using Microsoft SAM.

# Installation
Download the zip from the releases and extract it's contents to ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins.

# Customizing sounds
To customize sounds, open the `UltraRankSounds` panel in the plugin configs. \
Then click on `Open sounds folder` and just replace any sound file. \
Which file names associate to which rank should be pretty self-explanitory.
